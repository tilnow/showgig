how to show a gig
*spider chart based on:
time duration (assume all are immediate)
intensity
reliability& consistency of gig (volatility?)
management
s/w
words
visual
work/talk balance
-what else do you look for in a gig?

*map of country with blob of the size of relevent area (can be whole world). but how will we recognize. also, whole world shows whole world. so maybe we show a map and on the map a circle.
->how about user can decide on size of map cenetered on his click-location and can also choose size of click location (e.g., in km). as always, each click is a factor of 2 or 4, starting from 10km
*keywords (up to six?), like sql, spss, blockchain, etc.
*free text

how to make that show
*have a web page where one enters the data and gets a gig number (like knewit), that has as an image the image and the keywords and the text

how to show what one is looking for? can be the same

downside - no spirit, all technical details. but still
